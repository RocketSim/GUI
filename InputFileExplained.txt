user assigns the run a name
Define output file path
Define what the control file path is. File that the programme checks for live runtime commands 
Space for some additional sim commands.
Stage1 assigned name
Stage1 requirements before entering defined here
Body1 assigned name
Body1.PropName assigned. Repeated for all properties and bodies
Stage2 assigned name
Stage2 requirements before entering defined here
Bodies redefined here.

If a body has the same property as a body in the previous stage but the property is not known during parsing
i.e. the mass of a body stays the same between stages. A command which assigns the property a pointer to the 
same memory adress to another property needs to exist


File read in line by line
anything in " " will be used as the values for properties on the same line
i.e. Body1.Mass "10" will assign 10 to the mass of Body1.
Spaces will be ignored
\n will be required at the end of each line

For human readabillity the structure outlined here. Although it would not be difficult to make it so that the lines 
could be in any order. However, I imagine debugging will be much harder.
